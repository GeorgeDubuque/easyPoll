# ezpoll

Welcome to ezpoll! This application allows you to easily create and share polls within text message threads. Designed with a focus on usability and integration, this app leverages modern technologies to deliver a seamless polling experience.

## Inspiration

ezpoll was inspired by the many group texts that I am a part of, where no one could seem to make a decision and there was no simple and easy way to create a poll. Other polling apps either require you to log in or are way too complicated for simple use cases like this. ezpoll allows users to vote directly within the group text, making it incredibly convenient.
